# This .gitignore file is optimized for Unity projects.
# It helps to exclude generated files, caches, and temporary assets
# that shouldn't be tracked by Git.

# Unity Generated
# --------------------
# These folders are automatically generated by Unity and can be
# recreated locally. They are usually large and contain machine-specific data.

# Files generated by common IDEs that are specific to your local setup.

# Local history files (e.g., from plugins like Visual Studio Code's Local History)
.localhistory/

# Optional: Large File Storage (LFS) Placeholders
# -----------------------------------------------
# If you are using Git LFS, you might want to track some large binary assets,
# but ensure the actual binary files are not committed directly.
# This section ensures that if you haven't set up LFS correctly,
# these large files are still ignored.
# You would usually remove these if you *are* using LFS for these types.
# *.psd
# *.blend
# *.fbx
# *.wav
# *.mp3
# *.ogg
# *.mov
# *.mp4
# *.avi
# *.zip
# *.rar
# *.7z

# Remember to place this file in the root directory of your Unity project,
# alongside your 'Assets' and 'ProjectSettings' folders.
